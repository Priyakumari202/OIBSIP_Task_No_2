This is more than a portfolio; it's an invitation to explore, learn, and connect. So, immerse yourself and enjoy the journey.

While I wholeheartedly encourage you to utilise my portfolio as a springboard for your own creative ventures, I would like to kindly ask that, in the spirit of fairness and recognition, you provide attribution to michaelyeates.co.uk. Your support in acknowledging the origin of this portfolio is greatly appreciated.

I kindly urge you to abstain from portraying either the portfolio or the projects as products of your own authorship. The energy and time devoted to shaping this portfolio reflect my personal journey and aspirations.

Thank you for your understanding, and for embracing the ethos of creativity, authenticity, and shared respect that underpins our digital community. Your appreciation means a lot!

If you like what you see, I'd be truly grateful if you consider giving it a star ðŸŒŸ
